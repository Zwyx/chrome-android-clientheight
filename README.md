# Observe the bug

- Open Chrome on an Android phone,
- open a new tab,
- enter the address https://zwyx.github.io/chrome-android-clientheight/ **and press the Enter key of your keyboard to navigate to this address**,
- notice that the dialog is not vertically centered,
- click the green button,
- notice that the RED BUTTON is actually the one being clicked,
- notice that the dialog is now vertically centered.

If the red button isn't clicked (it might depend on the height of your device), you should still observe the dialog jumping up to be vertically centered.
